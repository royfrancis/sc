## Longevity-Scilife

Temporary data and script for Scilife drop-in. 

Workflow and script is in this file: `script.Rmd`. Other files are count data (`brain-counts.txt`), metadata (`brain-meta.txt`) and a `functions.R` file for extra functions.

The html version of `script.Rmd` can be viewed [here](http://royfrancis.github.io/sc/).
